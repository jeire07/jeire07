- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeire07,
I'm working on a program to verify the functionality of a product.

- 👀 I am very interested in what I am doing now and the field of game development

- 🌱 I'm using C# to improve my application now, and when I'm less busy, I'm studying C++. However, I'm not busy, and I'm not interested in studying C# continuously

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate...
